            <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
            <p>
                The purpose of this site is to provide an online information center where people in the region 
                may go to keep themselves updated on the local weather and events. This site is  
                also meant to be an online resource for people to learn about the area and some of its history. 
                It is meant to be a resource for tourists to get information on the cities in the region. The 
                highest priority of this site is to benefit as many members of the local communities as is 
                possible. On this site they will be able to find out what is going on locally. They will also
                be able to get the local weather forecast and in addition receive added insight from the local 
                leaders, organizations, and residents as to what affect that will have on their local events. 
                In the case of an extreme weather event, advised safety precautions will be given and the 
                guidance of the local leaders will be passed on to the regions.
