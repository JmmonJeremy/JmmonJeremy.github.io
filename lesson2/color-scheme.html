            <h2>Color Scheme</h2>
            <p>
                I chose the colors four of the five colors in my color scheme for three main reasons.
                First, I wanted to use colors that meshed well with each other and with my icon. Second, 
                I wanted colors that could be connected with the purpose of the web site. Third, I wanted 
                to use colors that would subconsciously send a positve message about the web site. Here's 
                the colors I chose and more specifics on the reasons.
            </p>
            <h2>Orange & Yellow</h2>
            <p>
                I chose this orange color (HEX #FF9E80) to use in my website on the header background, 
                navigation tracking light, and footer text information along with this yellow color (HEX #FFFF00) 
                to use on the navigaton links and for the website's update information lettering  in the 
                footer because I wanted to use bright and cheerful colors to bring accross a positve feeling 
                when people were on the site. I thought this color of orange and this yellow color were perfect 
                because orange implies a friendly, fun time is ahead and yellow implies optimism and happiness. 
                In addition both colors can be related to a beautiful sunrise, sunset, or even a rainbow. Finally, 
                this oragne meshes well with the website's icon and the yellow and orange go well with the dark 
                blue that I chose.
            </p>
            <h2>Dark & Light Blue</h2>
            <p> 
                I chose this dark blue color (HEX #1A237E) to use in my website on the website title, the navigaton 
                bar background and the footer background as well as this light blue color (HEX #E3F0FF) to use for 
                the websites body background because I again wanted to use some blue colors to tie the website 
                into the sky and even rain as well. In addition I wanted to subconsciously send the message of 
                dependability and reassurance that blue implies. Finally, I chose these blue colors because they
                meshed well with the yellow and orange colors I'd chose and the amount of contrast I was looking 
                for.
            </p>
            <h2>Gray, Black & White</h2>
            <p>
                The final gray color that I chose (HEX #474747) to use on the background surrounding the website, 
                as well as the simple black and white colors I used were chosen because they brought the right 
                amount of contrast and made things easy to read and look at.
