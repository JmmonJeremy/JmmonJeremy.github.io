      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Our goal is to expand our business and to increase our company's profits. In order to do this, we will be clearly informing the public of the available services and products that we offer. We will entice the public to use our services by also portraying the happiness and satisfaction that will result from creating a personal adventure using our services. We want to portray the value of the experience that a customer will have. We want to present a clear perception that we are a quality company that provides an excellent value for the consumer's investment in our services and products.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>There are three main target audiences we will be focusing on. The first target group is families (specifically the parents - because they will be making the decision and paying the bill). The families we will be focusing on will have teenagers within the family who are looking to have a fun time or an adventure in the outdoors. The parents will be looking for a fun family experience that is exciting and yet safe enough for the whole family. They will also want the experience to help bring their family closer together. This focus group will most likely access our site on their phone, but they could also do so on a laptop or desktop computer. The second target audience consists of social groups (such as church groups, club associations, and camping groups). This audience will be made up of people ranging in age from approximately twelve to sixty years of age. The main need we will be trying to fill is providing an activity that will be a fun experience that can deepen relationships among the group. This focus group will also most likely access our site on their phone. The final target audience will be businesses groups seeking to build team unity. This group will be made up of adults between the ages of twenty to sixty years of age. They will be seeking a safe and satisfying activity that can be used to teach principles of teamwork. This target group will most likely access our site on a laptop or desktop computer.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- You are not required to use this logo for your site…but you must have a logo for your website.  I can offer additional logos to use, or you can create your own-->

      <h2>
        Style Guide
      </h2>

      <!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

      <h3>
        Color Palette
      </h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      <p>Palette URL: <a href="https://coolors.co/020664-f71735-647aa3-95b2b0-ff9f1c" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/020664-f71735-647aa3-95b2b0-ff9f1c</a></p>


      <table class="colors">
        <tr><th>Primary</th><th>Secondary</th><th>Accent 1</th><th>Accent 2</th></tr>
        <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
        <tr><td class="primary">#2C90B2</td><td class="secondary">#95B2B0</td><td class="accent1">#FF9F1C</td><td class="accent2">#020664</td></tr>
      </table>

      <!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

      <h3>
        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Permanent Marker  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        I chose this font because its rounded letters give a water like look to the letters and also give the appearance of movement like rapids. I thought this would be a fun font for headlines and would also be a good contrast from the paragraph font.  <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Open Sans  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        I chose Open Sans for the paragraph font because it is very readable. I also thought it was close enough to the Courier New (monospace) that was listed as a safe font for the web by WCSchools.org. I also think this font adds a professional look to the type.  <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Normal paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p>
        The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company offers rafting on the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood Springs.  Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Colored paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p class="colored">
        Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for physically fit and experienced rafters.  No matter what type of river adventures you are seeking, White Water Rafting Company can make it happen for you. 
      </p>

        The Site Map of a site is just like it sounds…it is a map of the pages in a site and how they are related and linked together. From the map above we can see that we will eventually have the Home page and 2 sub or child pages.
      </p>  
      <p>
        The lines that connect them all together indicate that each page should be accessible from any other page, it is essentially showing us the global navigation for the site.
      </p>
      <!--
Choose your pages that you will create and put the names inside the two child page boxes… Some suggestions are below:

•	FAQ
•	Blog
•	Contact Us
•	Rivers We Run
•	Schedule/Rates/Dates -->

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Wireframes are like blueprints for making webpages.  They should show the major sections of content that will be on the page and the relative locations of each element.  In the wireframe below you can see there will be 6 sections to our page:</p>
      <h3>
        Home Page's Wireframe
      </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>At the top we have a section with the logo (the box with the mountain means an image) and the navigation bar.</li>
        <li>Then there is a banner image that stretches all the way across the screen.</li>
        <li>Next we have some text and an image </li>
        <li>...followed by another row made up of an image and some text.</li>
        <li>Then one more section of text with no image.</li>
        <li>Lastly, a footer containing a copyright/name line and 3  social media icons. </li>
      </ol>
