    <p>I am not sure if I will be able to succeed at my ultimate desire for my career path. I am trying to learn how to program and write code so that I can develop my own set of electronic tools to make mental health counseling tools more accessible to the public at large. If push comes to shove, I will be satisfied with a job in the tech world where I can provide well for my family.</p>
      
    <p>I enjoy many things, but what I enjoy most is centered around people, especially those closest to me. I love helping people, spending time with family, camping, and creating things that are useful to other people.</p>
      
    <p>I essentially have two families. I have five grown children from my first marriage and one little 18 month old girl from my current and second marriage. I currently have three grandchildren as well. It is a little strange, but my three grandchildren are all older than my youngest daughter.</p>
      
    <p>I used to work as a certified nursing assistant in a hospital, but after several back surgeries and other complications I am now pursuing an education in the tech industry. I am excited about using code to help create things in this industry.</p>
      
    <p>I am pursuing a BS in Technology at BYUI. I got started through the Pathways program. I love how affordable BYUI makes it for furthering your education. I also like how there is an emphasis on faith in Christ.</p>
      
    <p>I love being able to create a web page. Web design is exciting to me. Being able to market you ideas through a web page is a valuable tool. I hope to be able to reach more people with my ideas with the help of these skills.</p>
      
    <p>I was born and raised in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. I served a mission in Munich, Germany from 1991 to 1993. One of my favorite scriptures in Alma 37:6, which states "by bsmall and simple things are great things brought to pass; and small means in many instances doth confound the wise." I think there is great wisdom contained within those words.</p>
      
    <p> I am excited to get to know and work with my classmates within this class. I enjoy working with and learning from others.</p>
