                FamilySearch uses the design principle of visual hierarchy to guide you through their site. 
                Your eyes are first drawn to the smiling boy holding the portrait. From their your eyes fall 
                onto the portrait. The portrait then in turn leads you to the largest headline on their 
                web page about finding you and your family. Your eyes then naturally fall to the subtext for 
                that title and then finally land on the "Get Started" button. After that your eyes travel to 
                the headline at the top of the page. Then the color and size of the FamilySearch logo catches 
                your attention. From their your eyes are drawn to the register button under the tree. Then 
                your eyes travel to the help and menu buttons. Finally, your eyes go to the subtext surrounding 
                the top heading. FamilySearch's site skillfully uses pictures, text sizes, location of items, 
                and colors to lead you through their web page.

            <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
            <h3>Red Robin</h3>

            <p>
                This screenshot demonstrates an excellent use of white space to give the web site a clean 
                looking design. The first thing that really jumps out at you on this page is the hamburger. 
                This is because there is so much white space around the hamburger. Next, the Red Robin logo 
                at the top grabs your attention along with the menu and find location buttons. The buttons 
                are evenly spaced and have plenty of white space surrounding them. Their red color and all 
                their surrounding white space, really help them to stand out. Finally, the different food 
                category buttons are placed below that in an orderly, straight and evenly spaced line with 
                appropriate white space between them to make them easy to access. The more I look at this 
                page, the more I want to click a button and order some food. This is positive proof that 
                Red Robin's approach and use of white space on their site is extremely effective.

            <h2>Repetition</h2>
            <h3>Target</h3>
            <a href="https://www.target.com/" target="_blank">target.com</a>
            <img src="/sources/target.jpg" alt="Mobile view screenshot of Target's web page">
            <p>
                Target's website is an excellent example of the design principle of repetition. In Target's 
                web page the color red is repeated throughout the site. You find it in the Target logo, 
                in the header, in the references to savings, and in the call-to-action button. Their use of 
                the color red to make an association with their company is effective. Red isn't the only 
                repetition they use, in addition the Target logo and the "% off" is repeated twice helping to put 
                emphasis on those things. Then the shaded backdrop of palm tree leaves is repeated three times
                to help tie their adds into summer wear. The final and most numerous repetition is 
                the drop-down arrows. They are repeated four times, which helps to emphasize their importance. 
                All of these repetitions in such a small space helps to effectively drive home 
                Target's intended messages and bring consistency and order to the web page's presentation.
